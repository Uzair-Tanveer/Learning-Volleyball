# Learning-Volleyball

This Projetc is a class project that was used to express my knowledge of Html and CSS. The project called for the use of internal and external styling, as well as the use of pictures, ordered and unordered lists, as well as consistent and user friendly styling and colors.

I added my own JavaScript to show my knowledge and to refresh my memory. The JavaScript was used to create a button in the footer that would show the copyright in a popup format, and then disappear after a set number of seconds.
